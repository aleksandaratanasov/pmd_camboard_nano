I. Poisson surface reconstruction - creates water-tight mesh. In order to produce
a mesh with great quality we need to:
1)capture the object from as many sides as possible
2)merge all in a single point cloud
3)remove outliers
4)filter
5)apply Poisson surface reconstruction

If the point cloud is not "closed" this will result in a mesh of poor quality
